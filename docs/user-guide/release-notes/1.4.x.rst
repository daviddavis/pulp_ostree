Pulp OSTree 1.4 Release Notes
=============================


Pulp OSTree 1.4.0
=================

You can see the :fixedbugs_pulp_ostree:`list of bugs fixed<1.4.0>`.

New Features
------------

- The publishing algorithm has been enhanced to better determine each branch
  HEAD. Rather than ordering the branch commits (content units) by the date
  `created`, the publisher inspects the commit history. This is a more reliable
  method that also supports rebased commits.

- The model removed the `created` field because it is no longer used.
